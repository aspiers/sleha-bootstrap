== Unclear Responsibility ==

These may be in purview of sleha-bootstrap, or may be in appliance image:

* install debuginfo packages
* enable coredumps


== General / Random ==

* get rid of curses junk in log file (fix ENV term)
* Multi-device SBD (use multiple -s args)
* Start new node on standby
  # crm configure node node-1 attributes standby="on" 
  # crm node clearstate node-1  (requires confirmation)
  - start new node, unbelievably it works!
  # crm node online node-1
* don't error to log if log not started
* is "partx -a <device>" any sort of sane replacement for partprobe?


== STONITH Config ==

* See https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722405 for stonith timeout suggestions
* Drop no-quorum-policy=ignore when > 2 nodes.


== Template Mode ==

Generally specific to OCFS2 template ATM, as that's the only one extant.

* Very long path to partition (/dev/disk/by-path/... for iSCSI) means we
  can't determine paths to new partitions, thanks to bnc#722959.  Unclear
  if this will be fixed for SP2.
* /dev/disk/by-id/dm-name paths are unreliable (at least for determining
  partitions after carving the device up).
* Probably need to prompt user for new partitions after carving, should
  they not be found (FFS).
* ocfs2 template is not the same as Hawk's.  Consider enhancing
  sleha-bootstrap so it uses Hawk's templates directly rather than using
  its own.
* Ensure required RPMs are installed when running template (they're just
  Recommends in the spec)
* Specifying sbd without ocfs2 partition may be incompatible with ocfs2
  template (need to test)
* block device size " blockdev --getsz" etc. (when making OCFS2 partition
  with "-T vmstore")
